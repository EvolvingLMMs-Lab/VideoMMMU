The Hoyt sector model suggests that cities grow in wedge-shaped sectors radiating from the CBD, primarily influenced by transportation routes and economic activities.\n3. The city model introduced at 3:40  asserts that cities develop around multiple centers or nodes, each serving distinct economic and social functions, rather than relying on a single CBD.\n4. The galactic model focuses on the uniform circular growth of cities with the CBD at the center, emphasizing balanced development in all directions.\n5. The Latin American city model integrates elements from both the concentric zone and sector models, highlighting the impact of colonization and the presence of spines leading to malls.",

The cognitive perspective focuses primarily on unconscious motives and early childhood experiences to explain behavior.\n2. Humanistic psychologists emphasize free will, personal growth, and self-actualization as key components of human behavior.\n3. The behavioral perspective is concerned with how genetics and brain chemistry influence observable behaviors.\n4. Evolutionary psychology seeks to understand how natural selection and adaptation have shaped human thinking and behavior.\n5. The sociocultural perspective examines how social interactions, cultural norms, and societal structures influence individual behavior and mental processes.",

Identify which statements are correct.\nScenarios:\n\\bullet Maria struggles with a fear of public speaking. According to her, this fear stems from unresolved conflicts during her childhood, which she is not consciously aware of.\n\\bullet Tom often procrastinates and performs poorly in his academic work. He attributes his struggles to his negative thoughts about his own abilities.\n\\bullet Lisa is working on personal growth and aims to achieve her full potential. She seeks to improve her self-esteem through various self-help strategies.\n\\bullet Jason is highly competitive and believes that his competitive nature helps him secure resources and succeed in his endeavors.\nStatements:\n1. A researcher studying the influence of neurotransmitter imbalances on bipolar disorder is working from the biological perspective.\n2. According to the biological perspective, Maria's inability to overcome her fear of public speaking is primarily due to her unresolved unconscious conflicts from childhood.\n3. Cognitive psychologists would investigate how Tom's negative thought patterns contribute to his procrastination and low academic performance.\n4. The humanistic perspective would aim to assist Lisa in achieving her full potential by fostering personal growth and self-esteem.\n5. Evolutionary psychology might examine how Jason's competitive nature could have been beneficial for securing resources in ancestral environments.",

A natural quasi-experiment involves the manipulation of independent variables by the researcher in a controlled environment to determine their effect on dependent variables.\n2. Naturalistic observation requires researchers to observe subjects in their natural environments without any interference or manipulation, thereby ensuring high ecological validity.\n3. Laboratory experiments allow researchers to control and manipulate variables precisely, which increases the internal validity of the study but may reduce its ecological validity.\n4. In a natural quasi-experiment, the independent variable is manipulated by the researcher to observe its effects on the dependent variable in a real-world setting.\n5. Correlational studies can establish causal relationships between variables by measuring the strength and direction of their association.",
